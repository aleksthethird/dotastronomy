<p>Wow does it feel good to make a huge headline first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Breakfast at Pembroke College is between 8:30 and 9:30, but they basically shut down at 9:10. It always feels like I have to do a point landing with a really tiny parachute, and the point is defended by giant lobsters. Interesting challenge, but essentially impossible. n other news, I never made it. Failure is the essence of the game.</p>

<p>The naming issue. While it is true that hacks are not just coding, most hacks of course end up being coding. The question is why. And I can’t help but wonder that it has something to do with calling it a hack. It doesn’t matter what the intention is. By calling it a hack day you attract people who do coding or hardware or web design hacks, which means you exclude (or scare) others. If someone manages to go to dotastro who is not a proficient coder (in some way) or scared by coding - but may have brilliant ideas. It is difficult to criticize something that works so well as dotastro, but the hack day is the main reason why I’ve only been at 3 out of 8 dotastros. A different name might not be the ultimate solution, but it certainly helps. </p>

<p>I’m team Maker Day, for the reference. I used to be a hacker. But now I’m a maker.</p>

<p>Until today I thought the hack days were the reason why I wasn’t at all the other dotastro conferences. Hack days are threatening to me, mostly because skills (lack of skills) and ideas (lack of ideas) are immediately in the open. Openness implies a loss of control and therefore a threat. But fear of hack day is apparently not my only problem.</p>

<p>Dotastro is a socially challenging conference. At a normal conference, I can prepare every social interaction in advance. I know exactly what is going to happen. I can plan my conversations, prepare questions, and flowchart my way to the possible outcomes. Dotastro, by its nature, is unpredictable, which makes most of my elaborated social strategies useless. Day three stumbles from talks to unconference to falling asleep, and becomes increasingly dominated by a mixture of excitement, anxiety and despair. What a relief to realise that nobody objects when I just sit there in silence and stare into my screen. </p>

<p>Talking about WETI is always fun though.</p>
