<p>9:00. The North Terminal in Gatwick looks like it is currently actively deconstructed. I am unshaved, extremely tired and dressed in international hobo style. It was an eventful night. Four hours ago I drove to the airport, along the coast. The Sun, lightless and huge, was hanging over Kincraig Point behind the clouds. Even earlier Lebron James saved the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio, and the rest of his kingdom. I was very pleased. Meanwhile, the weather turned from relatively shitty to not even funny anymore. Over the entire week I had agonized whether to wear the brown or grey hoodie, now I decide to wear both. Even earlier that night I found out how to create webpages in Git and even earlier I finally convinced myself that I can't live without Git anymore. In that sense, dotastronomy day zero was already a success. I didn't sleep though. My mind feels like a plastic bag filled with pink meat.</p>
