<p>9:00. The North Terminal in Gatwick looks like it is currently being actively deconstructed. I am unshaved, extremely tired and dressed in international spacko style. It was an eventful night. Four hours ago I drove to the airport, along the coast. The Sun, lightless and huge, hung over Kincraig Point behind the clouds. Even earlier Lebron James saved the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio, and the rest of his kingdom. I was very pleased. Meanwhile, the weather turned from relatively shitty to not even funny anymore. Over the entire week I had agonized whether to wear the brown or grey hoodie, now I decide to wear both. Even earlier that night I found out that Git can create webpages and even earlier I finally convinced myself that I can't live without Git anymore (I'm an early late adopter, okay). In that sense, dotastronomy day zero was already a success. It was an eventful night in the East Neuk, but I didn't sleep. My mind feels like a plastic bag filled with pink meat. Over on Twitter, Geert threatens to turn into a robot. </p>

<p>This is an experiment, by the way. It is not actually meant as a liveblog. I would like to find out if it makes sense for me to use Github as repository for everything that doesn't fit on Google Drive, so, everything with Markup basically. My most fundamental requirement is that it sits in a browser, and nowhere else. No compromises. Local files as backup and for offline work are bonus. Requirement two: It has to be simple, so simple, that I can explain it to co-authors in 30 seconds. Right now, on day zero, I'm typing this in the Git editor straight into HMTL, which feels like blogging would have felt in the 1980s. Tomorrow I'm going to try something new, hopefully informed by dotastronomy. And at the end I'm going to delete everything out of desperation, probably.</p>

<p>17:00. Day zero is over. Lesson learned: There are a million ways to demonstrate and teach coding, but only very few of them make sense to me. Clear favourite: Python Notebook, even better when run in a browser (mybinder). One screen, no switching, everything reproducible. Also, how difficult it is to find out what is really going on in your audience. Asking definitely doesn't work. People lie, all the time, particularly if they are helpless, immobile and tired.</p>

<p>19:00. Ongoing conversation with myself what dotastronomy is about. From the outside, it definitely looks like a conference for astro coder, and whenever I talk about dotastro, that's exactly the impression I get. That has consequences of course on the diversity of the participants. The focus on skills is terrifying, even for me, and I have made a career out of not knowing anything. But the core idea of dotastronomy is different, as far as I understand it. It is very much about new forms of science and science communication, mediated through the internet, which does include tech skills, but a lot more. At dotastro 4 in Heidelberg 6 out of 12 talks were decidedly not about programming. Was that an exception or the rule? </p>
