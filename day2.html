<p>Day 2 is Hack Day. And this page is automatically produced by StackEdit. While I’m writing in a simple, but aesthetically pleasing editor, I’m watching the webpage grow on the other half of the screen. If I want to. At the same time, the text is maintained locally, synchronised and saved to Google Drive, and published through Github. Beautiful stuff. It actually looks much nicer in the editor than online.</p>

<p>(Reminder: This is not actually a liveblog, but a test of tools for online writing tools. Stackedit feels good so far and can create mathematical equations in LaTeX. Here a particularly stupid example: <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-44">\sin{x} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^2}</script></p>
