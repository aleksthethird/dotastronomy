<p>Day 2 is Hack Day. And this page is automatically produced by StackEdit. While I’m writing in a simple, but aesthetically pleasing editor, I’m watching the webpage grow on the other half of the screen. If I want to. At the same time, the text is maintained locally, synchronised and saved to Google Drive, and published through Github. Beautiful stuff. It actually looks much nicer in the editor than online.</p>

<p>(Reminder: This is not actually a liveblog, but a test of tools for online writing tools. Stackedit feels good so far and can create mathematical equations in LaTeX, a clear bonus over GDocs. Here a particularly stupid example: <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-215">\sin{x} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^2}</script>)</p>

<p>15:00. I’ve missed you, stackedit. I’ve missed watching the text grow on the right side while typing on the left. I missed the light grey screen background. I missed your understated signature, ‘written with stackedit’, which is much better than my signature. Is a text written by a tool or by an authors? What is more important? </p>

<p>And now I’m talking to you, you tool, that’s probably not a good sign. This is a novel written from the perspective of a typewriter. What am I doing here. Why is the line spacing in the editor slightly bigger than in the typeset version? How do I change that? I guess I would need a different HTML template. </p>

<p>In any case, while I was missing you, stackedit, I was doing research on conferences because, I don’t know. Now I’m enjoying the pleasant phase of watching a dataset grow and waiting for trends to emerge. Or wishing for trends to emerge. Noise can be beautiful, but it’s so frustrating. </p>

<p>Okay. Today I have founded a new branch of science. It is called conmetrics, clearly the best name for this kind of crooked adventure. Here is the critical plot.</p>

<p>(By the way, this image is produced locally in Python and uploaded in Git. Now that I think of it this should have been a Python notebook that runs online and can directly write to this page, but, oh, well.)</p>

<p>In any case, this is kind of like an HR diagram for conferences. The con-index is the hours of talks per day divided by the female-male ratio among speakers, and THAT number is my golden indicator for the quality of a conference. </p>

<p>Hack Day had a very different rhythm than the previous day. Whereas on Tuesday I was blown away all the time, like being on cocaine and watching action movies at the same time, Wednesday had more focus, more work, more frustration, but also more satisfaction at the end. Although I didn’t directly collaborate with anyone, it felt like being part of dozens of projects, all over the place. Maybe this is the most important function of a hack day - to break the monotony of conferencing, to provide a relief from talks and sessions, and to create real and virtual co-working spaces. If this is important, then hack day has to be in the middle of the conference, not around the edges. And everybody has to be part of it.</p>

<p>Good night, stackedit. I will not leave you tomorrow, because, just, I, I mean. I can’t.</p>
